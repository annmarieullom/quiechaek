I've seen a lot of posts and comments about this, many of which spreading misinformation, some going as far as stating that Acceptance Speech will be re-released this year, entirely re-recorded. I'd like to set the record straight. Acceptance Speech is NOT being re-recorded in any form, like Tree City Sessions was handled.

In MGS2, Otacon's stepsister blames him for not saving her when Huey attempted a double suicide with her because Otacon was sleeping with her mom. It wasn't Otacon's fault, EE's mom was the one who seduced him into it, which Huey caught them and committed suicide. Blame the mom, not Otacon. And there's Josh from Drake and Josh.

I just had my first brew day since July over the weekend. I'm excited to get back into it and decided to make a simple extract kit Kolsch. I wanted to use gelatin to help clear the Kolsch so it looks proper. Unfortunately, I may have misread some online instructions. I hydrated it with some cold water and then added boiling water to dissolve it after an hour or so. I then dumped it into the fermenter, added my wort and water (to bring it up to 5 gallons), and pitched my liquid. Moraff Fancy Jiggler, —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ.

These two songs are just pure gold. DT pointing fun at the clones who try to take after DGD and other bands at Rise is just pure gold. And Johnny's vocals on Swan Soup are just gold, and Will is just amazing as always. Find great deals on eBay for jigglers.

Hi all, I am new to canning (and gardening but that is another matter, but suffice to say I didn't have high expectations for the amount my garden would produce and am now about to drown in green beans). At I have read that beans and other veggies need to be canned using a pressure canner, and while I have minimal experience with canning peaches and other fruits using a water bath, I have never entered into the world of pressure canning.
